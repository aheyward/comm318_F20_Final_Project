## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project


### Project Presentation and Target Audience:
The file`Final_Project_Presentation` [(linked here)](https://commjhub.asc.upenn.edu/user/aheyward/notebooks/comm318_F20/comm318_F20_Final_Project/data_story_presentation/Final_Project_Presentation.ipynb) is the final output of my publication. My main research question was "What are the effects of parents spending more time with their children during the global pandemic?" Given that the focus of the presentation is on child education, my target audience was parents, especially those who are now working from home. This pandemic has brought about many uncertainties, and with schools closed, parents could be wondering how their children will fare without having in-person instruction. This being the case, final presentation could have been a data journalism article in a parenting magazine or another news publication.
