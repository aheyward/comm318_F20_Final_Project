    "This notebook does some early cleaning of a data frame with indicators for child well-being in OECD member nations and those same indicators for some nations who are not in the OECD. This notebook also gives a general look at the distribution of some of the variables. The data was pulled for the [OECD's database](https://stats.oecd.org/) underneath the section on \"Social Protection and Well-Being\" which also includes data on poverty/wealth distribution, gender, and general well-being. I wanted any data I used to be recent and I wanted to do some temporal analysis, so I chose data from 2014 to 2018 to explore. These explorations include: \n",
    "* How many observations and variables are there?\n",
    "* How many data values are there for each year in the 5-year period?\n",
    "* How many data values are there for each indicator of child-well-being?\n",
    "* For each country in the data set, which year provides the most data values? \n",
    "* For each indicator, how many values are there per year?\n",
